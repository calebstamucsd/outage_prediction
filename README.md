# Outage Prediction

## Framing the Problem

In this project, I will be using regression techniques in an effort to predict the number of customers affected by a particular power outage. 

I think this variable is the best and most interesting way to evaluate the severity of a power outage. While the duration of a power outage is likely to be dependent mainly on technical factors on the provider's side of things, the number of customers affected is also based on the demographics and conditions of the area where the outage happens. Thus, I expect a different set of feature vectors to be relevant for this question, taking more sociological and economic factors into account.

I will be evaluating my model's performance using the coefficient of determination, R^2^. R^2^ is the statistic of choice for regression models, as its an accurate and intuitive identifier of how well a model fits a given prediction problem.
